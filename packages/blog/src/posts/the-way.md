1. Less is impossible, more is unnecessary
1. Tech-debt is cheapest to pay the moment you stumble upon it
1. Habits, not goals

1. Develop habits that effortlessly compound than on reaching milestones. Keep adding tests, practice continuous refactoring, train the MVP muscle even at story level
1. _Just in place_: Hierarchical MVC
1. _One way street_: Always forward, never comply with the past. Use effort to bring the past forward, instead of wasting it to satisfy backwards compatibility.
